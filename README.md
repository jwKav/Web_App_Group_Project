# **Restaurant Project**
Full stack development of web app to book restaurant reservations.

## Tools used
### Draw.io
- Designed the entity tables of the online booking system for customers to show their relationships before we start making the API to help visualise the connections.
- Also created flow diagrams to display the booking system process.
                   
### Visual Studios
- API & MVC to display data and make the bookings. Made database from scratch, with the different tables.

### Github
- Used the 'Projects' tab to help us create a backlog, and organise tasks into the form of user stories. Also using github as a form of version control

## How we are working
We are working in an agile way, using the Scrum methodology working in sprints. Sprint 0 is our current planning phase, which is in progress and almost complete. Once we have completed our planning phase, we will check with our client whether this is okay and if so, we will start our first sprint.

## Getting Started
When starting this project, we started off with making user stories to match our backlog, to help us organise the sprints we set ourselves. We made the user stories in a way that would enable anyone reading it to understand what functions the web app will be able to carry out, while also making it clear to us what we want to achieve. We can also use these user stories to make tests towards the end of project to ensure everything is working as it should be.

## The Project
### The database
We made the database from scratch using C# code in Visual Studio, where we made different classes to represent each entity table we made. Initially, this database was empty, with just the columns we need to include. We have now added information to each column to show on the API through the MVC controllers.
### The API
We have created the API and MVC controllers to show data on a web page. These are 2 seperate projects which are run simultaneously, where we will be adding the CRUD (Get, Post, Put, Delete) operations so that customers can edit, delete or update their bookings if necessary.
