# _Restaurant Project_
Full stack development of web app to book restaurant reservations.

## Tools used
### Draw.io
- Designed the entity tables of the online booking system for customers to show their relationships before we start making the API to help visualise the connections.
- Also created flow diagrams to display the booking system process.
                   
### Visual Studios
- API & MVC to display data and make the bookings. Made database from scratch, with the different tables.

### Github
- Used the 'Projects' tab to help us create a backlog, and organise tasks into the form of user stories. Also using github as a form of version control
