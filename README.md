# <span style="text-decoration:underline">Restaurant Project</span>
Full stack development of web app to book restaurant reservations.

## Tools used
### Draw.io
- Designed the entity tables of the online booking system for customers to show their relationships before we start making the API to help visualise the connections.
- Also created flow diagrams to display the booking system process.
                   
### Visual Studios
- API & MVC to display data and make the bookings. Made database from scratch, with the different tables.

### Github
- Used the 'Projects' tab to help us create a backlog, and organise tasks into the form of user stories. Also using github as a form of version control

## How we are working

## Getting Started
When starting this project, we started off with making user stories to match our backlog, to help us organise the sprints we set ourselves. We made the user stories in a way that would enable anyone reading it to understand what functions the web app will be able to carry out, while also making it clear to us what we want to achieve. We can also use these user stories to make tests towards the end of project to ensure everything is working as it should be.
