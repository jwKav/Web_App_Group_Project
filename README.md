# Restaurant Project
Full stack development of web app to book restaurant reservations.

## Tools used
Draw.io - Used to make the tables and show their relationships before we start making the API to help visualise the connections
          Also used this to create flow diagram to display the process of booking a table over the web API.
Visual Studios - API & MVC to display data and make the bookings. Made database from scratch, with the different tables.
Github - Used the 'Projects' tab to help us create a backlog, and organise tasks into the form of user stories. Also using github as a form of version control
